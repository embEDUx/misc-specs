This repository should contain platform specific files which are needed at boot time. For example the propertary firmware blobs for the raspberry pi. The files in this repository will be stored on the boot partition of the platform by the [flash tool](https://apu.in.htwg-konstanz.de/labworks-embEDUx/flash_tool)

**Each platform has to have its own branch within this repository**
